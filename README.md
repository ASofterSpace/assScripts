# assScripts

**Class:** A Softer Space Internal

**Language:** BASH

**Platform:** Server

This is a collection of (mostly unrelated) scripts that didn't really make sense to be included anywhere else.

## Setup

Just download the scripts here and possibly call something like this:

```
chmod +x *.sh
```

to make them executable - and then you are ready to go!

## License

We at A Softer Space really love the Unlicense, which pretty much allows anyone to do anything with this source code.
For more info, see the file UNLICENSE.
